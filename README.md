# The Witcher 3 | Smart Camera
A mod that controls the camera positioning during combat so that you don't have to
manage it yourself. Mainly aimed at gamepads.

# Showcase

# Installing
The mod is modular, you can choose to install the core version (the fight camera) without the horse camera. However it is not possible to do the opposite as the horse camera depends on the combat camera.
